				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>How to use the Movedo Theme auto Update</h2>

				and enter your Themeforest username and an API key (from Envato).
				<br>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>How to update Movedo (old-school method)</h2>

					<li>Delete Movedo </li>

				</ol>

			<div>
				<h1>Home & Blog Page</h1>
				Create a new page from <strong>Pages > Add New</strong>. Give a title, like 'Home', add the elements and settings you wish and then publish it.
				Next, create another page with the title you want for your blog. You do not need any content for your main blog page.
				The next thing is to tell WordPress to use your pages appropriately. Go to <strong>Settings > Reading</strong> and set the 'Front page displays' to 'A static page'.
				Set the home page you just created as the 'Front page', and the blog page you created as the 'Posts page' and save your changes.
				<br>
				Your Home and Blog pages are ready to go!
				<div class="grve-note">
					When you set a page as your blog through the above-mentioned way you can select the style you wish in Theme Options > Blog Options.
					Changes there will also affect Archives / Categories / Tags overview pages.
				</div>
			</div>

			<!-- Pane 04 -->
			<div>
				<h1>Menu System</h1>
				Movedo comes with two custom menus, one positioned in the header area(Header Menu) and the other in the copyright area(Footer Menu).
				To set up your custom menus simply:
				<ol>
					<li>Go to <strong>Appearance > Menus</strong>.</li>

				</ol>
				<h3>Mega Menu Built-in System</h3>

					<img src="images/mega-menu.png" alt="image">
				</div>
				<h3>Menu Button Item</h3>
				You can easily create colored menu buttons with the wording you want in any menu item of your menu.
				You can set the colors you prefer, primary colors are included, for the background and the hover color. See the picture below.
				<div class="grve-image">
					<img src="images/menu-button.png" alt="image">
				</div>
				<h3>Labeled Menu Item</h3>
				You can easily create labels with the wording you want in any menu item of your menu. Just add your text in the Label Text field.
				See picture below.
				<div class="grve-image">
					<img src="images/label-text.png" alt="image">
				</div>
				<h2>Anchor Menu / One Page Menu</h2>
				Additionally, Movedo offers the Anchor Menu per page option. Notice that, anchor menus are optimal for navigation within one page.
				To create such a menu in a page please do as follows. <br>
				<ol>

					<li>Save menu and use it by selecting it from the Page Options of the page (Anchor Navigation Menu or Main Navigation Menu). </li>
				</ol>
				<div class="grve-note">
					In the exact same way you can create one such menu for the Header Menu as well, so that you have a One Page site.
				</div>
				<h3>Set the Home Button in One Page version</h3>
				You can set a home button (with the behaviour of the back to top button) by creating a custom link with the following URL: <strong>#grve-goto-header</strong> See the picture below.
				<div class="grve-image">
					<img src="images/home-one-page.jpg" alt="image">

				<h1>Theme Options</h1>
				Movedo Option panel is built with the renowned <strong>Redux Framework</strong> and gives you many configuration options in a user-friendly environment. Click the Theme Options under Appearance from the main WordPress navigation and then you will be able to access and enjoy many core features of Movedo. All the options have detailed descriptions in order to explain their purpose.<br/><br/>

				Movedo’s main philosophy is that the user can have the power to make global settings from Theme Options on how to change the appearance of each Post format ( Pages/Posts) and in addition to be able to override almost everything through the Single Post formats (Pages/Posts). For example: Under Theme Options > Page Options you can select on whether you wish your Page header to overlap the content and select the Header Style you prefer (Default/Light/Dark). That means that the settings you will make will affect every single page of your site. In a  creation of a Page, you can surely override this selection (as and most of them). This is the Movedo Magic!	<br/><br/>

				<h2>Movedo Header</h2>
				For a better grasp of the full potential of the theme, it is worth having a look at the philosophy behind the Header.
				The Header in Movedo does not have predefined styles (like most themes), but the elements can be moved independently from each other.
				The elements one can add on Header may be the following:
				<ol>
					<li>Logo</li>
					<li>Menu</li>
					<li>Menu Elements (On/Off & Add various elements)</li>
					<li>TopBar Area (On/Off & Add various elements)</li>
				</ol>
				Most of these elements can have their own align without one’s place affecting the other’s. This way, virtually dozens of combinations can turn out.
				If you take into account the topbar that offers 2 places (left and right) and it’s of the logic On/Off and Add elements, Movedo can satisfy even the most demanding user.<br/>
				Last but not least, Movedo provides <strong>3 different Header Modes</strong> that you can find under <strong>Theme Options > Header Options > Header Mode</strong>. The Default Header Mode, the Logo on Top Mode and the Side Mode. All modes have their own settings (colors, logos etc).
				<br/><br/>
				<div class="grve-note">
					Don't forget that above your content you can set the default titles (posts, pages),
					the Feature section area ( available in pages and posts) and the Anchor menu ( field bar in posts and pages ) option.
				</div>
				<br/><br/>

				<h2>Movedo Layouts</h2>
				Movedo provides 3 different layouts you can select from in <strong>Theme Options > General Settings</strong>.
				<ol>
					<li>Stretched Layout</li>
					<li>Boxed Layout</li>
					<li>Framed Layout</li>
				</ol>
				<br/><br/>
				<h2>Movedo Footer</h2>
				Movedo provides multiple footer layouts that you can choose from.
				You can select various column layouts or have a single column if you wish.
				Go to <strong>Theme Options > Footer Options</strong> to build your footer.<br/>

				Afterwards the creation of your footer layout, you will probably want to add your content. Simply go to <strong>Appearance > Widgets</strong>.
				Drag any of the provided widgets to the footer widget areas (Footer 1-4), order and reorder them as you wish and customise the settings.<br/>
				In the Copyright Area you can add text (TinyMCE), socials and menu, centered or in the left-right corners.<br/><br/>

			<div>
				<h1>Typography Options</h1>
				This is a fully customizable font-related section.You can change the fonts and their style according to your tastes/needs for almost every single individual case. The font-sections are divided in such way, so you can easily find the font you seek to customize.

				A truly unique feature of Movedo is the Responsive Typography. You can fully customize the font-size for devices whether it is a tablet (in both landscape &amp; portrait) or a mobile device. Let’s see what is the Responsive Typography concept about. First of all, you set a Size Threshold of a given device.The size Threshold defines the minimum value point from which on the Responsive size ratio percentage will take effect.In other words in order to make use of a given Size Ratio percentage, the default font size under the Typography Options should be equal or larger than the Size Threshold, otherwise there will be no effect at all.You have three sections that are customizable:
				<ol>
					<li>The Responsive Headings, that define the Headings H1-H6</li>
					<li>The Responsive First group, that define the Title elements: Page / Post / Feature Section Titles</li>
					<li>The Responsive Second group, that define the Description elements: Page / Post / Feature Section Descriptions &amp; Leader Text, Subtitle Text, Link Texts and Buttons.</li>
				</ol>
				<div class="grve-image">

			<!-- Pane 07 -->
			<div>
				<h1>Page Options</h1>
				Let's create a new page by following the usual WordPress steps:
				<ol>
					<li>Go Pages > Add New</li>
					<li>Give the page title</li>
					<li>Add your content (use the amazing WPBakery Page Builder)</li>
				</ol>
				Just below the Tinymce Editor you will notice two meta boxes (sections for settings): One with the title <strong>'Page Options'</strong> and another with the title <strong>'Feature Section'</strong>.
				<hr>

				<h4>Page Options</h4>
				Here you can set everything you need apart from the content of the pages(you will use the awesome Page Builder for this). So, you will find the following, organized into tabs, sections:
				<ol>
					<li>Header/Main Menu</li>
					<li>Title/Description</li>
					<li>Content/Sidebars</li>
					<li>Sliding Area</li>
					<li>Scrolling Sections</li>
					<li>Extras</li>
					<li>Visibility</li>
				</ol>
					 With these options you can override any options you have set in Theme Options > Page Options. This means that you can handle individually each one of your pages.
					 We really believe that everyone MUST especially explore the Title/Description tab :)

				<div class="grve-image">
					<img src="images/page-options-movedo.png" alt="image">
				</div>

				<div class="grve-note">
					Keep in mind that "Inherit" means that the settings from the options panel of Movedo (Theme Options > Page Options) will occur.
				</div>
				<div class="grve-important">
					Under Content/Sidebars tab there are options to set up the paddings (spaces) among the content area (top, down) and the Header/Footer. For example if you need to collapse the first row of your content area or just your content area with the Header (or Feature/Title) you need to set the Top Padding to 0.
				</div>
				<hr>
				<h4>Feature Section</h4>
				Movedo gives you the chance to add one of five special elements and to integrate your header with the feature section (Header Integration option).
				You can select among:
				<ol>
					<li>Title</li>
					<li>Image</li>
					<li>Slider</li>
					<li>Video</li>
					<li>Google Map</li>
				</ol>
				Follow the guidelines to set up the Feature Element of your choice.
				In addition, it’s worth trying your site’s Header under the Feature section in any page you like. This way you can create pages of totally different style.
				Finally, you can define the height of your feature section. Choose a full width section or specify the height you prefer in percentage. Keep in mind that you can also enable the Title Parallax Effect and/or the Bottom Arrow.
				<div class="grve-note">
					Note: Here you can use any of the 3 different menus (Default/Light/Dark) with separate logos that Movedo offers.
				</div>
			</div>

			<!-- Pane 08 -->
			<div>
				<h1>Create Posts</h1>
				To create a Post, go to:
				<ol>
					<li>Posts > Add New</li>
					<li>Add a title</li>
					<li>Add some content</li>
					<li>Add categories and some tags</li>
				</ol>
				Movedo supports 6 custom post formats. These are: <strong>Standard, Gallery, Link, Quote, Video</strong> and <strong>Audio Post Format.</strong>
				You can simply choose the post format you need and follow the detailed instructions in the appeared metabox below the Tinymce editor.<br>
				Furthermore, you can set up the classic options (layout, sidebar, disable various post elements etc), just like in page options, under the 'Post Options' section.
				<hr>
				<h2>Post Options</h2>
				Here you can set everything you need (just like in Page Options) apart from the content of the posts (you can still use the awesome Page Builder for this). So, you will find the following, organized into tabs, sections:
				<ol>
					<li>Header/Main Menu</li>
					<li>Title/Description</li>
					<li>Content/Sidebars</li>
					<li>Sliding Area</li>
					<li>Extras</li>
					<li>Visibility</li>
				</ol>
				With these options, you can override any options you have set in <strong>Theme Options > Post Options</strong>. This means that you can handle individually each one of your posts. We really believe that everyone <strong>MUST especially explore the Title/Description tab.</strong>
				<hr>
				<h2>Standard Format Options</h2>
				These are options that are related to every single post format that someone uses. For example, there are different options for the standard post format and different ones for the quote post format. It is of great interest to use the Movedo Style in standard post format if you are to use either grid or masonry overview.
				<div class="grve-image">
					<img src="images/standard-format-options.png" alt="image">
				</div>
				<hr>
				<h2>Feature Section</h2>
				Last but not least, you can use the Feature Section in your single posts just like in pages.
				Movedo gives you the chance to add one of four following special elements. You can select among:
				<ol>
					<li>Title</li>
					<li>Image</li>
					<li>Slider (on the fly creation)</li>
					<li>Video</li>
					<li>Google Map</li>
				</ol>
				Follow the guidelines to set up the Feature Element of your choice. In addition, it’s worth trying your site’s Header under the Feature section in any post you like. This way you can create posts of totally different style.
				Finally, you can define the height of your feature section. Choose a full-width section or specify the height you prefer in percentage. In general, you are able to add various Effects in the Feature section elements.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<div class="grve-important">
					In case you use Standard post format (the most common post format), just upload a featured image via the WordPress classic meta box (at the lower right corner).
				</div>
				<div class="grve-important">
					You can enable/disable the Feature Section for each one of the custom post types (Pages, Posts, Portfolio Items) in <strong>Theme Options > Miscellaneous > Feature Section Post Types</strong>.
				</div>
			</div>

			<!-- Pane 09 -->
			<div>
				<h1>Portfolio Options</h1>
				To create a Portfolio Item, go to:
				<ol>
					<li>Portfolio > Add New</li>
					<li>Add a title</li>
					<li>Add some content (you can use WPBakery Page Builder)</li>
					<li>Add description for the title</li>
					<li>Add more details for the sidebar</li>
					<li>Add categories and item fields (extra info in a list style)</li>
					<li>Upload a featured image for your item</li>
				</ol>
				These are the basic settings you need to promote a work item in a very simple way. Furthermore, just below the editor, Blade provides for the portfolio items the same settings with the single pages. Finally, you can set some more advanced options for your portfolio media. Let’s see them briefly:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h4>Featured Image</h4>
				This is when you simply want only one image for your item (in overview and single view).
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h4>Classic Gallery</h4>
				Add the images you prefer and you’ll have a gallery  for your item.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h4>Vertical Gallery</h4>
				Add the images you prefer and you’ll have a vertical gallery for your item.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h4>Slider</h4>
				Add the images you prefer and you’ll get a slider presentation for your item.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h4>YouTube/Vimeo</h4>
				Add the video you prefer from YouTube/Vimeo and you’ll have it in the media section.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h4>HTML5 Video</h4>
				You can also add (after upload it) an HTML5 Video.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h4>None</h4>
				That means you disable the media and you prefer to use the feature section or the builder or simply no media. <br/><br/>
				<h4>Feature Section</h4>
				Last but not least, you can use the Feature Section in your single portfolio items just like in pages. Blade gives you the chance to add one of four special elements.
				You can select among:
				<ol>
					<li>Title</li>
					<li>Image</li>
					<li>Slider (on the fly creation)</li>
					<li>Video</li>
					<li>Google Map</li>
				</ol>
				Follow the guidelines to set up the Feature Element of your choice.
				In addition, it’s worth trying your site’s Header under the Feature section in any page you like. This way you can create pages of totally different style.
				Finally, you can define the height of your feature section. Choose a full width section or specify the height you prefer in pixels. In general, you are able to add various Effects in the Feature section elements.
				<div class="grve_note">
					Note: You can enable/disable the Feature Section for each one of the custom post types (Pages, Posts, Portfolio Items) in Theme Options > Miscellaneous > Feature Section Post Types.
				</div>

				<h1>Rows & Columns</h1>

				<h2>Setting your Rows</h2>
				It is very important for the user to know the options Movedo offers in Rows in order to place correctly the elements given.
				Options are plenty; let’s have a look:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h4>General</h4>
				<h5>Section ID</h5>
				Give a name/ID for the section (row). This will be useful if you need an anchor menu or create a one page (see Anchor Menus in this documentation).
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h5>Section Title</h5>
				Give a title for the section (row). This will be useful if you use the full page template with the side dot navigation (see Menus in this documentation).
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h5>Font Color</h5>
				Choose the color for your fonts so texts will be readable.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h5>Heading Color</h5>
				Set the color for your headings. Select among default, light, dark or one of the primary colors.

				<h2>How to translate the strings without WPML</h2>
				First of all, we recommend to use the <a href="http://poedit.net/" target="_blank">PO Edit</a>  to edit and/or translate the static strings of Movedo.
				When you install it follow the steps below:
				<ol>
					<li>Go to <strong>/movedo/languages/</strong> folder, duplicate the en_US.po file and rename it using the appropriate language code (for example if you translate to French you need to re-name it as fr_FR.po).
						You can find all the codes <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
					<li>Then open the renamed .po file with PO Edit.  Translate the strings in your language into the “Translation” column.</li>
					<li>Click to save the file when you finish the translation. Then an .mo file will be created in the same directory (just like en_US.mo file).</li>
					<li>Upload these 2 files in <strong>/movedo/languages/</strong> folder.</li>
					<li>Finally, you need to go to <strong>Settings > General</strong> and at the bottom of this page select your preferred language.</li>
				</ol>
				<div class="grve-important">
					Note: Keep in mind that you do not need to translate all the theme’s strings, you can freely choose what to translate.
				</div>

				<h2>Interested in translating a language for Movedo?</h2>

				In addition, we will include it in the next update of Movedo, so you won’t have to re-upload it. Finally, this will also help out many other users of Movedo.
